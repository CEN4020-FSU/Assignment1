Integration management: public developers send to the manager then manager send to blessed repository to developer private
Dictator and Lieutenants: manager send to blessed repositories then to the public developers while send to lieutenant then the manager

(J)
Because:
- Regular developers work on their topic branch and rebase their work on top of master. 
-Lieutenants merge the developers' topic branches into their master branch.
-The dictator merges the lieutenants' master branches into the dictatorâ€™s master branch.
the dictator pushes that master branch to the reference repository so the other developers can rebase on it.
